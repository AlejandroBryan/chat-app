## Description

In this Repository i will show up my learned skill on the "Native App Development & React Native" at [Carrerfoundry](https://careerfoundry.com). It consist of building [Chat-Demo](https://github.com/AlejandroBryan/chat-demo) a
chat application that allowed users to interact each other while send text messages, share their actual location and pictures on realtime.

Why using React Native?

React Native provide me some advantages like the familiarity with the syntax of React js library, why not just writing one source code that can run IOS and Android at the same time.
